            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Teamfight Tactics (TFT), a popular auto-battler game, may seem unrelated to physical health. However, recent studies suggest that engaging in strategic games like TFT can provide surprising cardiovascular benefits by reducing stress and improving cognitive focus.</p>

            <h2>Research Findings</h2>
            <p>Researchers at prestigious institutions like <strong>Harvard University</strong> and the <strong>University of Oxford</strong> have explored the connection between cognitive gaming and heart health. Their studies have shown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved stress management through focused gameplay.</li>
                <li>Reduction in cortisol levels, the primary stress hormone.</li>
                <li>Enhanced mental resilience, which correlates with better cardiovascular health.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For instance, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank">study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine</a> found that strategic gaming can lower heart rate variability (HRV) during high-pressure scenarios, promoting a calm and collected mindset.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>Mechanisms Behind the Benefits</h2>
            <p>Engaging in TFT requires strategic thinking, rapid decision-making, and emotional regulation, all of which activate the prefrontal cortex. This mental exercise has downstream effects on the autonomic nervous system, leading to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved heart rate control.</li>
                <li>Lower blood pressure during rest and activity.</li>
                <li>Better overall cardiovascular performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>While TFT and similar games can offer mental and cardiovascular benefits, moderation is key. Experts recommend balancing gameplay with regular physical activity and a healthy diet to maximize heart health. If you are curious about how gaming can affect your overall health, consult a medical professional or explore more peer-reviewed literature on the subject.</p>
